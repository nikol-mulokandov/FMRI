In this project, we analyzed brain activity data from 170 subjects across three regions (VIS, ATN, PCC) while they watched 14 short films and during rest periods.
The goal was to classify the specific movie based on brain activity using various classifiers (KNN, SVM, LDA, QDA, Naive Bayes) and k-fold cross-validation due to processing limitations.
The project focused on classification during the first and last 5 seconds of films and rest periods, with challenges arising from limited sample size.
